    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <p>
        <ul>
           <li>1 cup day old rice</li>
           <li>Any vegetable</li>
           <li>Meat/tofu</li>
           <li>2 or 3 eggs</li>
           <li>4 oz soy sauce</li>
           <li>green onions(optional)</li>
           <li>garlic(optional but recommended)</li>
           <li>ginger(also optional)</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>First thing you need to do is heat the stove to medium-high heat and place your wok. Add enough oil to coat the wok.</li>
            <li>Next, if you are using meat, cut it thinly and season with salt and pepper. If you want, you can add soy sauce and let it sit for a while.</li>
            <li>Once your meat is seasoned and ready, throw it into the wok and let it cook enough to get a nice crust on both sides. This shouldn't 
                take long if it's cut thinly.</li>
            <li>After the meat is cooked, remove it from the wok and throw in your veggies along with garlic and ginger if you have it.
                Let these cook until soft and fragrant.</li>
            <li>Once the veggies are close to being done, create some space in the wok and pour in your scrambled eggs. Stir vigorously until fluffy.</li>
            <li>When the eggs are fully cooked, add in the day old rice and meat that was cooked earlier.</li>
            <li>Finally, add soy sauce to taste, sprinkle on some chopped green onion, and you're done!</li>
        </ol>

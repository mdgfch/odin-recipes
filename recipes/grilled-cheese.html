    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      A grilled cheese sandwich is one of the simplest foods you can make. It's an american classic and everyone should know how to make one.
      There are really only three ingredients needed to make one.  
    </p>
   
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <p>
        <ul>
           <li>2 slices of bread</li>
           <li>2 slices of cheese</li>
           <li>butter</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>First thing you'll want to do is to place a frying pan on the stove and turn it to medium heat.</li>
            <li>Next, butter each slice of bread on one side.</li>
            <li>After the frying pan is hot, place one piece of bread, butter side down, followed by two slices of cheese and the other slice of bread stacked on top with the buttered side facing up.</li>
            <li>Once a crust forms on the bottom piece of bread and it releases from the pan easily, flip the sandwich over and cook a little bit longer.</li>
            <li>Finally, when the sandwich is browned on both sides, all that's left is to put it on a plate and eat it!</li>
        </ol>

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Birria is a Mexican dish from the state of Jalisco.
        It is a traditional stew made from a combination of chili pepper-based goat meat adobo,
        garlic, cumin, bay leaves, and thyme, cooked over low heat.
        Birria is slow stewed in a pot to create tender, juicy meat that shreds easily.

        The recipe I use is slightly less traditional, as it used ingredients 
        that will be available at most supermarkets in the United States. It requires patience
        to make it, but it is definitely worth it!
